                The Norwich Testing Initiative (NTI) is a newly formed initiative which will launch a large-scale screening pilot for SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the COVID-19 disease. The pilot begins on Monday 7 January 2021 and runs for four weeks. <br>
                To participate, people are asked to register and book one testing slot per week for two consecutive weeks. There are two testing slots for each working day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. In order to help with track and tracing, participants will need to provide some personal information when they sign up. Information such as first name, surname, age, gender, and ethnicity are required. In addition, the NTI would like to contact those who are tested positive, hence contact information such as phone number, house number, postcode and email address are essential.
